# Assignment 4
## Econ 8310 - Business Forecasting

Based on this Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yufengsui/mobile-games-ab-testing/data

Here is the Assignment 4 repository. See the "Questions" folder for two py scripts that correspond to the two questions asked in the Canvas quiz. The retention1Dingman.py covers the effects of moving the mobile game level gate from 30 to 40 on retention rates for 1 day. The retention7Dingman.py does the same but for 7 day retention rates. There is also a Frequentist Checks py file where I compare z scores to validate my Bayesian methods.

Note that all code was initially run in Google Colab because I didn't want to depreciated my numpy in order to get pymc to work in my local IDE.
